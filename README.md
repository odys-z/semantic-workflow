# semantic-workflow
A cheap workflow engine depends on semantic-transact.

This engine can work with the jclient/frame/cheap-client.js.

One of the important purpose for implementing the the engine is to show how powerful of semantic-transact's structurized sql composing API.

Although the logics supported is simple, only single thread without parallal branching but with support of looping, it's still been used in a few real enterprise projects.

In the future, this project will be replaced by a more powerful engine.
